# -PowerBI-Sales-Insights-Ecommerce-Dashboard
This project aims to develop a sales ecommerce dashboard using Power BI. 
The dashboard will provide a comprehensive view of order details and key metrics, such as revenue, order volume, average order value, and customer demographics. 
It will allow users to analyze sales performance, track trends, and identify top-selling products or regions.
Interactive visuals, filters, and drill-down capabilities will enable deeper insights into sales data, aiding in decision-making and optimizing ecommerce strategies.
